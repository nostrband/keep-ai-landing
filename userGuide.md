# Keep AI Landing Page - User Guide

## Purpose

Keep AI is a minimalist, privacy-first landing page for a personal AI assistant that helps you remember, plan, and manage life privately, with all data stored locally on your device. The page communicates trust, security, and minimalism through a calm, confident design.

## Powered by Manus

This landing page is built with cutting-edge web technologies: **React 19** with **TypeScript** for a responsive, interactive frontend, **Tailwind CSS 4** for utility-first styling, and **shadcn/ui** components for polished, accessible interactions. The design system uses a carefully curated color palette (deep slate #0B0F14, copper #c48e48, soft white) with **Inter** typography for clean, modern aesthetics. Deployment runs on auto-scaling infrastructure with global CDN for lightning-fast performance worldwide.

## Using Your Website

### Explore the Landing Page

The Keep AI landing page guides visitors through your product story in a single, flowing experience. Start by reading the **"Your life stays private"** headline and subheadline to immediately communicate the core value proposition. Click **"Join the waitlist"** to scroll directly to the email signup section, or click **"Learn how it works"** to jump to the features section.

### Understand the Core Features

The page highlights three core promises: **"Remembers for you"** (your assistant learns your patterns), **"Helps proactively"** (suggestions before you ask), and **"Keeps it private"** (all processing on your device). Below this, the **"Private by Design"** section explains the technical foundation: local-first architecture, end-to-end encryption, and zero access policy. The quote **"Keep AI can't leak what it never sees"** reinforces the privacy-first philosophy.

### Join the Waitlist

Scroll to the **"Be among the first to keep your life private"** section at the bottom. Enter your email address in the input field and click **"Join Waitlist"**. You'll see a confirmation message: **"✓ Thanks for joining! Check your email soon."** The form validates your email before submission to ensure data quality.

## Managing Your Website

Use the **Management UI** (accessible via the card buttons in the chatbox) to customize and monitor your landing page:

- **Preview Panel**: View your live landing page in real-time as you make changes
- **Code Panel**: Access all source files and download them for local backup
- **Settings Panel**: Update website name, logo, and visibility settings
- **Secrets Panel**: Manage environment variables safely (for future integrations)
